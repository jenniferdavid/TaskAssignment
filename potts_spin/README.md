Trials with POTTS_SPIN
=======================

You need [CMake][] and [Eigen][] v3.  Then everything is easy:

    git clone git@github.com:d.jenniferdavid/potts_spin
    mkdir potts_spin/build
    cd potts_spin/build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./potts_spin

As the name implies, this is based on [POTTS SPIN BASED NN][].
